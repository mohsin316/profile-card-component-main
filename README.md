### Built with

### Continued development

For future plans for now its to do more and more javascript. I just recently finished a course for it and i want to use my new hand skills and make amazing projects. super glad font end mentor exists. After playing around with Js i might study a framework or start a little bit on the backend. In fact i was considering looking up a few videos on using Figma and learn how to design proper websites.
